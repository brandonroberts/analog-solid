# Solid + Vite + Nitro

This is an example Solid application using the Vite/Nitro plugin from [AnalogJS](https://analogjs.org). The `@analogjs/vite-plugin-nitro` package can be used with any Vite-based application to provide:

- Hybrid Server-side Rendering
- Static Site Generation
- API Routes

## Setup

Run `pnpm install` to install the application dependencies.

## Development

Run `pnpm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application automatically reloads if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `pnpm run build` to build the client/server project. The client build artifacts are located in the `.output/public` directory. The server for the API build artifacts are located in the `.output/server` directory.
